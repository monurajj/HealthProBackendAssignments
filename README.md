QR Code Management Platform Backend
This project implements a backend system for a QR Code Management Platform that supports Dynamic QR Codes, Event Tracking, and Complete Analytics. The platform is designed for businesses to generate, manage, and analyze QR codes for marketing campaigns.

Key Features
Dynamic QR Codes

Update the URL associated with a QR code in real time without altering the physical QR code.
Event Tracking

Tracks every interaction with QR codes, including:
Timestamp
Location
Device/Browser metadata
Analytics

Provides detailed performance metrics such as total scans, unique users, geographic distribution, etc.
User Management

Ensures QR codes can only be accessed or edited by their respective owners.
